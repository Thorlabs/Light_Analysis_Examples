Software examples for Thorlabs' products that are used to measure light (e.g. CCS Series Spectrometers, PAX1000 Polarimeters, Wavefront Sensors, etc.)

## Repo Organization
All examples are split up by programming language and product type. Directions on using specific examples are given within the folders.

### C# and C++ Soft Requirements

Guides written for these examples are written with Microsoft's Visual Studio in mind, which can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
