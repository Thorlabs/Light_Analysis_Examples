## Included Examples

### Thorlabs CCS Spectrometer Control
These sample codes show how you can control a Thorlabs CCS spectrometer in Python.
They uses the ctypes library to load the DLL file for these spectrometers (https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes) and the Matplotlib library to plot the measured spectrum (see: https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html#). These libraries need to be installed separately on the computer.

Please note that the resource name (“USB0::0x1313::…”) in the sample code needs to be changed according to the used spectrometer type and unit.

### CCS using ctypes - Python 3.py

This example shows the basic operation of a CCS spectrometer. The necessary settings are made, a spectrum is recorded and then plotted.

### CCS using ctypes - Python 3 - absorption measurement.py

This example shows a more advanced operation for an absorption measurement. A reference spectrum (without sample) and a spectrum with sample is recorded. The absorption and the optical density of the sample are calculated from these spectra. All the data is plotted.
