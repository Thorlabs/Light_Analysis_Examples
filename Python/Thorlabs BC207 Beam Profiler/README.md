# TLBC2 sample 2D output

The sample code shows how to control a BC207 beam profiler in Python.
In the example the available beam profilers are found, a connection is extablished, several parameters are set, several output values are displayed and a 2D image is shown.
 
The code uses the ctypes library to load the DLL file for these power meters, the matplotlib library to create the image and the numpy library as a requirement for the matplotlib library. 
These libraries need to be installed separately on the computer.
