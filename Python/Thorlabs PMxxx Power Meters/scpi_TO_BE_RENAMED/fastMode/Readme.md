# Fast Mode Example
This command line sample demonstrates how to query fast measurement stream of Thorlabs Power Meter. 
Fast mode allows to fetch all measurement results of the meter as constant data stream. 
### fastMode.py
This example uses the anyvisa library.
### fastMode_pyvisa.py
This example uses the Pyvisa library. Switch driver to VISA.

# Details 

The fast measure stream needs to be queried as fast as possible to prevent data loss. The meter 
only buffers the recent 10 ms of data in the device. To speed up data exchange a binary format 
is used to exchange data. The fast measure stream does not support averaging or dBm unit. 
Please refer to the Meter datasheet to get the fast mode data rate. For PM5020 this is 100000 
Samples per Seconds. 

For more technical background information about fast mode refer to SCPI command description. You can find a description for every Meter in the  [commandDocu](../commandDocu) folder. For example the PM103 [SCPI command description](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Selanarixx/Light_Analysis_Examples/blob/develop/Python/Thorlabs%20PMxxx%20Power%20Meters/scpi/commandDocu/pm103.html) html file.

> [!NOTE]  
> Please ensure to call the correct fetch method. Use ```parseFastModeBinaryPM103()``` for PM103 and PM103E. For all other meters use ```parseFastModeBinary()```.

## Limitations
Please be aware the stream requires a high transfer bandwidth. Because of this you can not use 
serial interface to query fast measurement data. Also slow network connections can cause a 
loss of data. 

## anyvisa python Library
You can download anyvisa library wheel in this Github repository.
