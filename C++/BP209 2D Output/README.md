## Example Description
The sample code shows how to control a BP209 beam profiler in C++. In the example the available beam profilers are found, a connection is established, several parameters are set, several output values are displayed and a 2D image is shown.

The code uses OpenCV library to create the images. The OpenCV library needs to be installed on the computer. 

## Instructions for Use
### Install and Setup OpenCV for C++ in Windows
Please follow the steps below to setup the OpenCV for C++ in Windows. Please skip this section if OpenCV has set already. 
1. Download the OpenCV from its official website https://opencv.org/releases/. For a Windows System, please click on the 'Windows' button. 
2. Run the downloaded executable file and extract the OpenCV to the target folder.
3. Set the Environmental Variables:  
    - In Windows System, right-click on 'This PC', then press on 'Properties'. Then press on 'Advanced system settings'. A new window will open.  
    - Click on 'Environmental Variable' from there. Another window will open.   
    - In the "System variables' use the scroll bar and select 'Path'. Then click 'Edit'. Another window will open.  
    - Click 'New' and 'Browse', then find the location of the Extracted OpenCV folder. There's a folder named 'bin' under **...\opencv\build\x64\vc16**, Please add the path of 'bin' to the 'Edit environment variable' then click 'OK' to finish the environmental Variables setting.
4. Restart the computer. 

P.S. Recent Versions of OpenCV only provide 64-bit libs and dlls. To build a 32-bit version, please refer to the guides in https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html  


### Link Libraries with the Project
Guides written for this example is written with Microsoft's Visual Studio in mind. Other IDEs can be used, but instructions are not provided in this repository.
1. Create a new VC++ project file or open the existing VC++ project file 
2. Link the OpenCV library with Microsoft's Visual Studio:
    - Open Project\Properties\Configuration Properties\VC++ Directories\General
    - Enter the path **...\opencv\build\include** into Include Directories
    - Enter the path **...\opencv\build\x64\vc16\lib** into Library Directories
3. Under the Solution Explorer, right click the Source Files, then add the BP209_2D_output.cpp to the Source Files
4. Set the path of the BP209 header file according to the bit of the project you want to build:
    - Open Project\Properties\Configuration Properties\C/C++\General
    - Enter the path of the header files into Additional Include Directories (**C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\include** or **C:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\VISA\Win64\include**)
5. Set the path of the BP209 library according to the bit of the project you want to build:
    - Open Project\Properties\Configuration Properties\Linker\General
    - Enter the path of the library files into Additional Library Directories (**C:\Program Files (x86)\IVI Foundation\VISA\WinNT\lib\msc** or **C:\Program Files\IVI Foundation\VISA\Win64\Lib_x64\msc**)
6. Set the additional depended library:
    - Open Project\Properties\Configuration Properties\Linker\Input
    - Add **TLBP2_32.lib;** or **TLBP2_64.lib;** into Additional Dependencies according to the bit of the project you want to build;
    - Add **opencv_worldXXXd.lib;** and **opencv_worldXXX.lib;** into Additional Dependencies (Here 'XXX' means the version of the downloaded OpenCV, e.g. if the version is 4.9.0, you should enter opencv_world490d.lib and opencv_world490.lib. )
